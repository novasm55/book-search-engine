# 21 MERN: Book Search Engine

## Description

This is a book search engine application that uses the Google Books API. Originally, it was built with a RESTful API but has now been refactored to use a GraphQL API with Apollo Server. The app is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js). 

As an avid reader, you can search for new books and keep a list of books you'd like to purchase. User functionality allows you to create an account, log in, search for books, save books to your account, view your saved books, and remove books from your saved list.
